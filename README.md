# Penetration_Testing-Georgia_Weidman
Files and ressources created and used while reading Georgia Weidman's book "Penetration Testing", No Starch Press Edition. Some scripts/other can be different from the ones given by the Georgia Weidman. It's because the book is pretty old and some software aren't available or aren't best practice (python2.7 -> python3).
